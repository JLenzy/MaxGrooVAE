This repository contains a GrooVAE-Max for Live duo for taking a constant velocity groove pattern from the user, turning it to a 2 bar drum composition and playing it back in Ableton Live.

It works only with 4-4 time signature for 2 bars with 1/16th note steps. The system can work in real-time in the sense that the composition of the next 2 bars would be completed before 2 bars worth of time until about 150 BPMs.
